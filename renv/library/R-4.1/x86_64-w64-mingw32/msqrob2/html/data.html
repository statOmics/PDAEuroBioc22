<h2>Example data for 100 proteins</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Subset of peptides from 100 proteins from a quantitative mass spectrometry
based proteomics dataset (PRIDE identifier: PXD003881 Shen et al. (2018)).
E. Coli lysates were spiked at five different concentrations (3%, 4.5%, 6%,
7.5% and 9%wt/wt) in a stable human background (4 repl. per treatment). The
twenty resulting samples were run on an Orbitrap Fusion mass spectrometer.
Raw data files were processed with MaxQuant (version 1.6.1.0, Cox and Mann
(2008)) using default search settings unless otherwise noted. Spectra were
searched against the UniProtKB/SwissProt human and E. Coli reference
proteome databases (07/06/2018), concatenated with the default Maxquant
contaminant database. Carbamidomethylation of Cystein was set as a fixed
modification, and oxidation of Methionine and acetylation of the protein
amino-terminus were allowed as variable modifications. In silico cleavage
was set to use trypsin/P, allowing two miscleavages. Match between runs
was also enabled using default settings. The resulting peptide-to-spectrum
matches (PSMs) were filtered by MaxQuant at 1% FDR.
